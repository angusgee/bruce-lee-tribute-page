          Bruce Lee, born in 1940 in San Francisco and raised in Hong Kong, was
          a martial artist, actor, and cultural icon whose influence transcended
          borders. Known for his pioneering approach to martial arts and
          philosophy, Lee founded his own style, Jeet Kune Do, blending various
          combat techniques. He gained fame with his roles in The Green Hornet
          and classic martial arts films like Enter the Dragon. Beyond his
          cinematic legacy, Lee's philosophies on self-expression and physical
          mastery continue to inspire millions. Despite his untimely death at
          32, his impact on martial arts and popular culture endures globally.
